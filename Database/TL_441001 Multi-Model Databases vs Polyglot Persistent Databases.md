## decentralized, distributed and centralized

- Centralization and decentralization relate to the level of control.
    - In a **centralized** system, control is exerted by just one entity
    - In a **decentralized** system, there is no single controlling entity. Instead, control is shared among several independent entities.
- **Non-distributed** (or co-located) system, all the parts of the system are in the same physical location
- **Distribution** relates to differences of location, parts of the system exist in separate locations
    - Difficult to maintain, stable, more secure, have more network speed, and are more scalable
- **Centralized** data system is where all the data in a single computer, access the information you must access the main computer of the system
    - The easiest to maintain but unstable, less secure, less scalable
- **Decentralized + Distributed** system can be Bitcoin Blockchain
- **Centralized + Distributed** system is a cloud service provider

## Characteris

- **Security**
    - centralized: has access to the server with the information, can modify any data.
    - distributed: data is distributed between the nodes of the network, modify data will be reflected in all nodes in network
- **Availability**
    - centralized: If have several requests, the server can break down and no longer respond
    - distributed: the pressure does not fall on a computer, but on the entire network, the total availability of the network is much greater than in the centralized one
- **Accessibility**
    - centralized: processes are standardized and can be inconvenient for customers
    - distributed: secure
- **Data transfer rates**
    - centralized: located in different countries or continents, the connection with the server can become a problem
    - distributed: can choose the node
- **Scalability**
    - centralized: networks are difficult to scale
    - distributed: easy, load is shared
