# Analyzing Business Domains

- `Can be divided 2 parts: **strategic** (what + why) and **tactical** (how) design`
- `Not all business problems are solved through algorithms or other technical solutions`

## What is business domain

- area of activity

## What is Subdomain

- To achieve its business domain’s goals and targets, a company has to operate in multiple subdomains 
- Type of
    - Core
        - what a company **does differently from its competitors**
        - are not necessarily technical
    - Generic
        -  are **business activities** that all companies are performing in the same way
    - Supporting

### Comparing Subdomains 

- Competitive advantage: Core
- Complexity: 
    - Supporting is simple, business logic obvious
    - Generic much more complicated
    - Core is complex
        - Should be as hard for competitors to copy as possible

### Volatility

- Core have to be tried out, refined, and optimized
- Supporting do not change often
- Generic subdomains can change over time, come in the form of security patches, bug fixes, or entirely new solutions to the generic problems

### Solution strategy

- Core expected to change often and continuously, require implementation of the most advanced engineering techniques.
- Supporting dont need advanced engineering techniques, so it can implement by out sourcing
- Generic can adopt an open source solution 

# Discovering Domain Knowledge

- Business problems appear both at the business domain and subdomain levels
- A software project’s success depends on the effectiveness of
knowledge sharing between domain experts and software engineers
