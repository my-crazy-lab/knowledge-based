## decentralized, distributed and centralized

- Centralization and decentralization relate to the level of control.
    - In a centralized system, control is exerted by just one entity
    - In a decentralized system, there is no single controlling entity. Instead, control is shared among several independent entities.
- Distribution relates to differences of location.
