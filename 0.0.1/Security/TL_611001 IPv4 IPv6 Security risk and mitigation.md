## Security risks of IPv4

- Spoofing
    - When an attacker sends a packet with a forged source address to trick the receiver into believing it came from a trusted source.
    - Can bypass authentication or redirect traffic to malicious sites 
- Sniffing
    - Attacker intercepts and reads the data packets sent or received by a device on a network, which can be used to steal sensitive information

## Mitigation strategies for IPv4

- Secure protocols, such as HTTPS, SSL, TLS, or IPsec
- Firewalls and filters
- Analyze and track the traffic and activity on your network

## Security risks of IPv6

- Transition mechanisms, such as tunneling or dual-stack, can introduce complexity and configuration issues that create vulnerabilities
- Extension headers can increase the size and complexity of packets, be abused by attackers to hide malicious data or bypass security measures
- Neighbor discovery protocol enables IPv6 devices to discover and communicate with each other on a local network, but it is vulnerable to spoofing, flooding, or redirection attacks

## Mitigation strategies for IPv6

- Secure protocols like HTTPS, SSL, TLS, or IPsec
- Network monitoring and auditing tools
- Configure your firewalls and filters
- Avoid using default or predictable addresses
